Customer segmentation gives useful business insights. We used different clustering algorithms such as k-means, DBSCAN and Agglomerative clustering to find meaningful clusters of customers. we divided customers into two and four groups based on evaluation metrics and business usefulness. We compared these groups in terms of their spending, review scores and other related metrics and provided actionable recommendations for each one of them.
